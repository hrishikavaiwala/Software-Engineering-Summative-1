# Software Engineering Summative 1 - Temperature Converter Web Application
## Plan
The creation and implementation of a temperature conversion application within my workplace will be a simple and beneficial tool. As part of the pharmaceutical industry, this application will allow scientists in and outside of laboratories to convert in three different temperature metrics:
* Celsius
* Fahrenheit
* Kelvin

The Standard International (SI) unit of thermodynamic temperature is Kelvin and is often preferred by scientists as the Kelvin temperature scale begins at where 0 reflects the complete absence of thermal energy.

### Application Requirements
This application has a number of functional and non-functional requirements that can be tested against to ensure the application meets user needs and performs as expected.
Functional Requirements:
* Temperature Conversions – The application must convert from Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin to the other two temperature metrics.
* User Input Handling – The application allows the user to input any numerical values in any of the three temperature boxes.
* Error Handling – User input must be validated as a valid number and display errors for invalid inputs.
* User Interface – A clear button must be included to reset all fields.
* Real-Time Conversion – The application must perform the conversions and display the results in real-time immediately after user input.

Non-Functional Requirements:
* Performance – The application must load and perform conversions in real-time without major delay.
* Reliability – The application must be compatible with major browsers and work on various devices including desktops and smartphones.
* Usability – The application must be simple to use through a clear user interface.
* Reliability – The application must consistently provide accurate temperature conversions.
* Security – All input data must be sanitised to prevent security vulnerabilities.
