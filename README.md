# Software Engineering Summative 1 - Temperature Converter Web Application
## Plan
The creation and implementation of a temperature conversion application within my workplace will be a simple and beneficial tool. As part of the pharmaceutical industry, this application will allow scientists in and outside of laboratories to convert in three different temperature metrics:
* Celsius
* Fahrenheit
* Kelvin

The Standard International (SI) unit of thermodynamic temperature is Kelvin and is often preferred by scientists as the Kelvin temperature scale begins at where 0 reflects the complete absence of thermal energy.

### Application Requirements
This application has a number of functional and non-functional requirements that can be tested against to ensure the application meets user needs and performs as expected.
Functional Requirements:
* Temperature Conversions – The application must convert from Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin to the other two temperature metrics.
* User Input Handling – The application allows the user to input any numerical values in any of the three temperature boxes.
* Error Handling – User input must be validated as a valid number and display errors for invalid inputs.
* User Interface – A clear button must be included to reset all fields.
* Real-Time Conversion – The application must perform the conversions and display the results in real-time immediately after user input.

Non-Functional Requirements:
* Performance – The application must load and perform conversions in real-time without major delay.
* Reliability – The application must be compatible with major browsers and work on various devices including desktops and smartphones.
* Usability – The application must be simple to use through a clear user interface.
* Reliability – The application must consistently provide accurate temperature conversions.
* Security – All input data must be sanitised to prevent security vulnerabilities.


## Design
![UI Prototypes](https://github.com/hrishikavaiwala/Software-Engineering-Summative-1/assets/126560322/d4bb7be7-bef9-4395-a944-07a4bfd19a47)

These designs was created via Miro as this provides a simple interface with access to shapes, a wireframe library and a variety of colours that can be leveraged to create a User Interface for my application. I created one base design in three different colours. These colours were checked against WCAG 2.1 which are guidelines for web accessibility. This was sent to a number of potential users for feedback and see which one they preferred before any coding is begun.
The results showed that the colour scheme users preferred was Prototype2 and feedback was giving that they would like the Clear button to be slightly larger. This will be taken into account during application development to ensure user needs are met.

## Project Management
To manage I have loosely followed the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The main phases I have taken from this methodology are: Plan, Design, Development, Testing, Maintenance. An Agile SDLC approach will be taken for this application which takes on an iterative approach to project development.
I have implemented this with a Kanban Board and tickets which can be done in a Sprint-like manner. This is where a short time period is allotted for a certain set amount of work to be completed.

### GitHub Project

Through the use of a ticketing system on the Kanban Board it is simple to see where each section of the project is at through different sections. When items are in backlog, they are either not priority items for that sprint, or are dependent on another ticket being completed. The other sections show when a ticket is ready to begin, is in progress, being tested or completed.
